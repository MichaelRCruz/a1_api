## Welcome to the fold!

This is my most sophisticated JSON API to date (be gentle; I am relatively new to the game). One of these days I'll start rockin' and rollin' with Python and Flask or something. Maybe jump on the Laravel train. Who knows.

This application serves my [sup_yo](https://github.com/MichaelRCruz/sup_yo) front end. There is nothing too fancy going on here except your basic CRUD functionality. As you can see, I have Mongoose working as my ORM which has allowed me to keep the database pretty normalized. The Oauth was sort of challenging. I think adding another strategy, such as Google, will give me more practice. Plus not everyone has a GitHub account.

CORS is very very interesting.

Take a look around though. One thing that I may need to revisit are the named routes. I like to follow best practices as closely as possible so it kind of bugs me when things are not quite right.
